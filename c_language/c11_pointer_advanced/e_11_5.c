// The so-called acrostic poem is that the first character of each line of a poem is connected together, and the content composed is the hidden information of the poem. Write a program to input an English acrostic poem, decode the acrostic poem and output its hidden information. The input acrostic poem is less than 20 lines, and each line does not exceed 80 characters. Use # as the input end mark, and use dynamic memory allocation method to process string input.
